    * Issue 3: Cater for UTF-8 characters in input file.
      See Issue https://github.com/goodvibes2/IngAusOfxFixWin/issues/3.
      The input file, as downloaded from ING Australia, *is* a UTF-8 file.
      Open the input and output files with CHAR_SET UTF-8 instead of US-ASCII.
      This is to fix IngAusOfxFix crashing with error message
        IOException: java.nio.charset.MalformedInputException: Input length = 1
      when it finds a non-ascii UTF-8 character in the input file.
      ENCODING:USASCII & CHARSET:1252 in input file are also changed to
      ENCODING:UTF-8   & CHARSET:NONE respectively in the output file.
      This is to allow UTF-8 characters to be imported into GnuCash.
